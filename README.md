Welcome to the Python Essential 2 repository! This repository contains a collection of Python programs designed to enhance your programming skills.

## Programs

1. **Greet User Function**
   - A function `greet_user` that takes one argument, `name`, and prints a greeting message.
   - The function is later modified to accept a second optional argument, `greeting`, with a default value of "Hello".

2. **Sum Numbers Function**
   - A function `sum_numbers` that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns their sum.

3. **Fruits List Operations**
   - Working with a list of fruits, several operations are performed including appending, removing, inserting, and sorting.

4. **Loop with Break**
   - A loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but stops if the number 7 is encountered using the `break` statement.

5. **Loop with Continue**
   - A loop that prints numbers from 1 to 10, but skips numbers that are multiples of 3 using the `continue` statement.
